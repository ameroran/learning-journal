# VCS 
The **VCS** can be rectified the problems in files and make some changes in files and there is many type of it, like: 
* Local .
* Centralized .
* Destributed .

The *local* need just for one database to save the changes , but the *centralized* need a server to save all changes. For *distributed* if happened any corruption in hard disk then all work and files will lost .

## Git
It's a version code system save data by snapshots. It's depends on local operation because it's use **database** in hard disk and files cannot lost like in server.

*Git* is improve to decrease the percent of irreversible damage and lost data.

The files in Git can reside in three states:
* Commited.
* Modified.
* Staged.

We can install it by three ways:
* as a backage.
* via another installer.
* Download and compile source code.

After do all steps and install it , the users should set the username and password. The files that saved it's in *checked out* or *untracked*.
