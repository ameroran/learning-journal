# How computer work

In this century , the computer has been able to change the world for it's immese ability to communicate , send information and many more.
I become necessary to know how it works and how to represent information inside it using electrical circuits. A computer depends in principle on it's work on four main tasks :
* Get input.
* Storing information.
* Data processing.
* Get outputs.

Old computer were slow and too large as room size . Where they only processed the numbers. 
Inputs give information to computers that is stored in memory . The processer change then by using on *algorithem* and then stores them back in memory until they are ready for output. The output of information depends on how computer is designed to do it.

All inputs and outputs are a type of information that can be represented by continuous or discrete electrical signals or ones and zeros .
The computer uses millions of small electronic components that make the circuits.

Calculations such as addition and subtraction can be done by using electrical circuits .
A simple circuits takes an electric signal and flips it, so if the signal you give is *1* the circuit gives you *0* and vice versa.
The complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results.
Some type of logic gates:
* AND.
* HAND.
* NOT .
* NOR.
* OR.

With one wire the electrisity flowing through it , the sigel will be on or off so with one wire we can represent yes or no , true or false, 1 or 0 .
