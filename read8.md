# Comparison operators 

By comparing a value in script to what you expect we can evaluate a situation , and the result is boolean .
### Types of comparison operators:
* == : It's compare between two values. if they are same.
* != : It's compare between two values to see if they are not same.
* === : It's compare two values to check the both are same in data and values.
* !== :It's compare two values to check if they are not same in data and values .
* >: It's check that the number in left bigger than the number in right .
* <: It's check the number in left is less than the number in right .
* >= : It's check if number on left is greater than or equal the right.
* <= : It's check if number on left is less than or equal the right.

# Logical Operators
It's an operator helping to compare of results of more than one comparsion operator. Some types :
* && : It's test more than one condition.
* || : It's test at least one condition.
* ! : It takes a single boolean value and inverts it.

# Loop
Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met. There are three types of loop:
* For : It's use to run a code a specific number of time , and the condition is a counter (it's tellhow many times the loop should run).
* While : It's used to know how many times the codes should run. If the condition is true then the code will continue.
* Do while : It's run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even the condition is false.
